+ Insure proper defineness checks are made whenever the :$raw option is used,
  and that :$raw defaults to False! A proper defineness check looks like this
  when specifying the return value:

    $a.defined ??
      ( $raw ?? $a !! Clutter::Actor.new($a) )
      !!
      ClutterActor;

- Simplify the interface for ::KeyframeTransition. Consider a "set-frames" key
  (which should NOT interfere with "frames") that will take either a raw list,
  or a list of tuples (just always flatten the result and insure (* % 3 == 0),
  and send the right arguments to the right calls, (ala key-frames, modes and
  values)
